🛠 Technical Decisions

Language: TypeScript (95.4%) → for type safety and maintainability.

Styling: CSS (3.6%) → for custom layouts and section styling.

⚔ Challenges & Solutions
Embedding Resume

Issue: Added in wrong section (Contact).

Solution: Moved to a dedicated Resume section with a Google Drive link.

LinkedIn Profile Redirect

Issue: “Share” link redirected to LinkedIn login.

Solution: Used public profile link to open directly.

🌱 Problem-Solving Approach

Divided portfolio into clear sections: About, Projects, Skills, Achievements, Resume, Contact, Beyond Tech.

Ensured all links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Resume, Email) are functional and accessible.

Focused on minimal, professional UI with responsiveness.

Solved issues step by step (resume embedding → LinkedIn link fix → balancing sections).
